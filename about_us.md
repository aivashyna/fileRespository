It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
